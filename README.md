# RaspberryPi


## Timelapse

Run `get_images.py` to collect the sequence of images (see script to determine frames/interval/duration) and then run `timelapse.py` in order to build the timelapse mp4. Makes use of RaspberryPi Camera module


## Blackjack

Script to read playing card images in the works. Part of a larger blackjack simulation project. Test image is `img008.jpg`

- [ ] Reading and displaying the test image using `opencv`.
- [ ] Read the value of all cards. May need a better camera (?).
- [ ] Showing card values back thru command line in rpi program.
- [ ] Building a static card reader table or auto detection of card system, whichever proves easier.
- [ ] Convert card-reading to real-time. Not yet sure the limitations of this with rpi camera.
